Signage
=======
A tool created to allow non-designers to easily create A4-size signs for conferences, conventions or other events.

Usage
=====
Add backgrounds to the backgrounds folder, truetype fonts to the fonts folder, and then just make sure the server is setup properly to serve the files.

Note that this tool will only work in newer html5/css3 capable browsers - so there's a fair chance IE won't run it (haven't tested).
